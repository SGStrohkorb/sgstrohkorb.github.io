            <p class='text-center'>Teaching a class is not an opportunity that many undergraduate students get to have. I was lucky enough to be hired as a ME 212 Engineering Graphics Instructor at Kansas State University for the Spring and Fall of 2018. Engineering Graphics is a lab that meets two times a week for three hour sessions each. The class teaches students the basics in hand drafting and SolidWorks, our CAD software. I was responsible for teaching one of those days, as well as grading the homework. I also participated in the creation of exams and their grading.</p>

            <p class='text-center'>But this experience was much more than just teaching my students and grading. I learned how to prepare class content. I went over my slides before I got to class, several times. I went over the examples I wanted to do, to make sure I did them right in front of my students. I made sure I knew how to do the homework, so when they had questions, I could answer them.</p>

            <p class='text-center'>Answering questions was one of the hardest parts of this job. SolidWorks is a great piece of software, but somehow my students would regularly come across error messages I had never seen before. Thus, I had to be able to diagnose their problem right there, because often times there were multiple people that had a question. So I got good at tracing through their process and found out where they went wrong. I also made myself available to my students through email and text, which worked out surprisingly well.</p>

            <p class='text-center'>Instructing Engineering Graphics isn't just about the students either. We had weekly meetings with all of the instructors, most of whom are undergraduates. I learned how to interact with them in a professional manor, which really helped when some of them were not the easiest to work with. This taught me a lot about office dynamics and now not to usurp someone's power. I am glad I learned these skills now before my full time job after I graduate.</p>

            <p class='text-center'>Overall, I am really glad I took this position when I did. It taught me many good skills as an instructor, but also as a person. I am no longer teaching due to my schedule and stress of instructing. I was putting many hours a week (up to 20) into that job and with my current course work, I can no longer instruct and have a life outside of school work.</p>
