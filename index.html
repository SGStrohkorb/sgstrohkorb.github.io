            <p class='text-center'>Hello! I am Sam Strohkorb and welcome to my website. I am a Junior at Kansas State University and I am studying both Mathematics and Mechanical Engineering, with an expected graduation date of December 2020. I have also taken the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program through <a href='https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t'>Udacity</a>. My passion is for solving problems, primarily through code. These problems can exist in a physical (mechanical), mathematics, or data science/machine learning domain.</p>

            <p class='text-center'>My journey as a growing engineer and coder flourished in high school, when I was involved with <a href='https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc'>FIRST FRC</a> Team 2410, <a href='http://mmr2410.com/'>The Metal Mustangs</a>. This gave me exposure to mechanical, electrical, computer, and software engineering. I got to experience four years of solving many different problems, but most importantly, I was allowed and encouraged to fail. These failures ultimately lead to better designs and helped me develop my own design process.</p>

            <p class='text-center'>With my experience in FIRST Robotics, I decided to do my capstone project at Udacity on match prediction for FIRST FRC events. I first learned how to use <a href='https://www.thebluealliance.com/apidocs/v3'>The Blue Alliance API v3</a> to collect the match and ranking data I needed. Then I applied my knowledge of supervised and unsupervised learning to predict the outcome of FIRST FRC matches with a 90% accuracy and F1 score. You can read more about this <a href='/udacity_capstone'>here</a></p>

            <p class='text-center'>But I was not done with FIRST Robotics. I wanted to share my predictive statistics of FIRST FRC matches with the rest of the world. Thus, I build a prototype website (not currently available) to allow any FIRST FRC team to use the predictive statistics for their scouting efforts. This required me to learn how to use AWS EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk, Route 53, and CloudWatch. You can read more about this <a href='/predict_first'>here</a></p>

            <p class='text-center'>Enough of FIRST FRC and more about my experience at Kansas State University. I was able to teach ME 212 Engineering Graphics for two semesters, Spring and Fall of 2018. I was responsible for teaching one of two labs a week, aiding in the creation and grading homeworks, as well as exams. I also made myself available to my students in person, by email, and also text, which worked out surprisingly well. You can read more about this <a href='/graphics'>here</a></p>

            <p class='text-center'>Other notable experience at Kansas State University include conducting ML research, grading for the math department, and developing a system for tracking MPFD (Micro-Pocket Fission Detectors) Disks for K-State's S.M.A.R.T. Lab.</p>

            <p class='text-center'>This whole website was coded myself, using Bootstrap 4. Just press F12 to see more! You can view the source <a href='https://github.com/SGStrohkorb/sgstrohkorb.github.io'>here</a>.</p>
