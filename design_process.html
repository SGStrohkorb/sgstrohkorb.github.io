            <p class='text-center'>My design process is ever evolving. I began designing as a kid playing with Legos, never following the instructions. I had a vision in my head about what I wanted to build, then through trial and error, I got it build. When I got a little older, I got a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms_NXT'>Lego Mindstorm NXT</a> kit. I was still able to build what I wanted without any outside help, I could build even more complex models with the aid of other resources. So, research became an important part to building a new design.</p>

            <p class='text-center'>While on FIRST FRC Team 2410, The Metal Mustangs, I quickly realized that I did not have the experience or education to figure out everything I needed to to solve the problem I faced. Thus, I began to research. I talked with the mentors of the team, my fellow team members, and the forums of <a href='https://www.chiefdelphi.com/'>Chief Delphi</a>. Next I prototyped my design out in CAD, followed up by actually building it. Then came the fun part, testing the limits of the designs until they broke and I would begin the process over again.</p>

            <p class='text-center'>I began to "code" when I was a sophomore in high school, with HTML. I disliked it at the time and picked up real programming about a year later with python. I learned through <a href='https://www.codecademy.com/'>Codecademy</a>. I then began trying to solve problems through python, learning new libraries and skills throughout the process. I would try to calculate prime numbers, do large matrix calculations, or try to make minesweeper in the command line. Through all of these projects, I learned to love the speed of prototyping with code. Something is broken? Try fixing a line here or there and run it again. This debugging process is something I've been getting better at over the years and now I can sometimes catch bugs before they happen.</p>

            <p class='text-center'>Now through my experiences programming, I have generalized my design process into 5 steps. First, I define the problem. I try to gather all of the relevant information I can around the problem and try to see it from many different angles. Second, I begin brainstorming solutions to the problem. At first, no idea is too crazy. But I try to narrow down the solutions that both easy to implement and efficient (in terms of money, time, resources, etc...). By the end of this process, I generally have a good ideas what solution I want to take. Third, I implement this solution. Fourth, I test the solution and see where it can be optimized. I have never the most optimal code the first time through. I like to profile my code to see what takes the longest and try to optimize that first. Fifth, I evaluate my solution and see how well it solves the problem. At this point, I will often loop back to the first step of gathering all relevant information and begin the process again. Once I get a good enough product (I don't believe there is ever a perfect product), I am done!</p>

            <p class='text-center'>This design process is not "special" or "magical", but it is the most optimal way I have how to solve many problems over the years. What I love most about this process is my ability to remember what I did in last projects. For example, when I developed the MPFD Disc Tracking System for K-State's S.M.A.R.T. Lab, I used Django for my back end. Then when I was developing my Predict FIRST project, I remembered in the research phase that I used Django before. This allowed me to skip having to do research into what back end I wanted to use and ultimately saved me time and headache learning a new back end</p>
